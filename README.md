accumulatedRotation = indicates how much a cube has rotated
angle = indicates the overall angle of the cube
direction = indicates the direction of the rotation
rotationSpeed = how fast the rotations are going to be
curAngle = indicates the current angle of the cube in XYZ
keyPressed = indicates the user input
keyFlag = flag to indicate whether a keypress will be taken as input 
cumulativeDistance = distance that the cubes will expand to
expandFlag = flag to indicate whether the expand interaction is valid
